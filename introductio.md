# Introductio

As customary, we shall provide a brief summary of the material addressed, reiterating warnings and potential argumentative pitfalls. First and foremost, this is not an attempt to reinterpret the theory in a revisionist manner, nor to establish a new school of socionics. What is proposed here is a correct interpretation, strictly bound to what something is *in itself*, and not to the contingent effects of its manifestation—that is, not to a description of the subjective observation projected by the subject onto the object.

For this reason, specific points will be raised in which the theory is commonly employed in an erroneous manner. At various moments, the argument will approach a critique of what ought to have been correctly described; at others, it will assume an explicitly didactic character, in the sense of exposing what something is with rigor.

It should be borne in mind that, in proceeding with the reading, the reader accepts the premises established here, which present neither internal inconsistency nor contradiction with socionics as a system. Should one believe to identify an inconsistency, it is possible that—as occurs with many others—one is operating from a mistaken understanding of the theory, or lacks the critical distance required for the proper analysis of a theoretical body.

**Common errors to be avoided:**

1 — There is nothing “behind” what is stated: everything written corresponds exactly to what is intended, without subtexts, hidden metaphors, or implicit intentions.  
2 — Objections grounded exclusively in appeals to authority of the form “such-and-such author stated” will be disregarded, since this very procedure constitutes a central part of the problem diagnosed here.  
3 — It is necessary to comprehend the argument in its entirety before presenting objections or proposing interpretative advances; partial critiques formulated without apprehension of the whole lack analytical value.
