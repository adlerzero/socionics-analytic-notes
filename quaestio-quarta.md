It is therefore natural that an interpretation may arise according to which a certain phenomenologism underlies the explanations presented thus far; for precisely this reason, it becomes necessary to address this point more exhaustively. Everything exposed up to this point does not concern a direct ontological phenomenon—that is, it is not an immediate or “tactile” description of what occurs at the level of events—but an investigation into why these events occur as they do. This is, therefore, an eminently epistemological problem, and it is within this domain—not the phenomenological—that socionics properly operates.

In other words, the production of observable behaviors does not in itself constitute the material object of study. The focus instead lies on the formal components of phenomena as interpreted by different types, which operate within a standard deviation determined by their specific cognitive structure. What is analyzed, therefore, is not behavior as a raw event, but the manner in which certain aspects of the phenomenon are privileged, organized, and rendered intelligible by the intellect.

From this it follows that empirical examples—such as that of an LSE who becomes an exceptionally precise and well-regarded psychiatrist—cannot be taken as direct evidence of the use of particular informational elements. The fact that an LSE performs excellently in clinical practice does not imply that *Fe* is being used to recognize causes and effects in patient behavior, just as an SLE oriented toward physical activity may perfectly well become a mathematician or historian. The decisive issue is not the empirical domain of activity, but where the individual’s epistemic attention is primarily allocated.

In this sense, an LSE may be a highly effective therapist precisely because of the capacity to organize, in a detailed and systematic manner, the relation between causes and effects of observed behaviors—that is, through the way *Ti* logically structures what *Te* manifests as effect. Even so, this competence does not allow one to infer, in a direct and necessary way, which elements are being employed in cognitive processing, especially given that intellectual functioning is profoundly influenced by extrinsic factors such as level of education, training, deliberate effort, and degree of dedication. Socionics, therefore, does not describe what an individual does, but how they tend to structure and interpret what they do.
