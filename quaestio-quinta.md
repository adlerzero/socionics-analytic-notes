# § Quaestio Quinta — De definitionibus formalibus axium

### §§ Articulus I — De Statico

Staticity in socionics, as has already been refuted and commented upon previously, is nothing other than an orientation toward conceptual contents that operate alongside immediate empirical reality. What does this mean? It means that reality in itself contains phenomena that would occur independently of subjective interpretation; however, when such phenomena are apprehended by the intellect, they are not primarily taken in their linear chain of effects, but elevated to a conceptual plane in which their stable and normative structures are investigated.

In this sense, one may affirm that the Static dichotomy operates with contents abstracted from effects: mathematics, logic, grammar, theory, regularities, and abstract systems. Everything that is conducted into an interpretative field that does not depend on the totality of empirical chaining may be described as Static. For this reason, it is common—though by no means fatalistic—to observe static types conversing and reasoning within abstract and normative structures.

Attention, in this case, anchors itself in regularities, categories, and relatively fixed forms. Interpretation does not focus on the concrete succession of events, but on the formulation of broad and general descriptions of phenomena, emphasizing the models and implicit norms that structure them. In this process, the functions operate in an articulated manner: one considers what was influenced, disturbed, preserved, or altered in the event (*Se*); investigates the causal structure or formal principle that explains the phenomenon (*Ti*); evaluates to what extent the result is desirable, appropriate, or problematic (*Fi*); and examines whether the phenomenon could have occurred otherwise, in different contexts or under other possible configurations (*Ne*).

### §§ Articulus II — De Dynamico

Before entering more deeply into the explanatory field of what is meant by the Dynamic, it is necessary to clarify a fundamental point: extroverted elements operate in a secondary manner relative to introverted elements—not in a hierarchical sense of value, but in the logical and epistemological sense of interpretative precedence. A correct reading must therefore recognize that, prior to any interaction with objects or phenomena whatsoever, there is always a prior subjective mediation, which may occur either passively (*Id*, *Super-Id*) or actively (*Ego*, *Superego*).

In other words, every external action presupposes a prior internal organization. Before reacting pragmatically to another person—whether by withdrawing, treating them well or poorly, kissing, embracing, expressing cordiality or hostility—there is an internal process of categorization that evaluates what that other is *for oneself*. This judgment need not be conscious or deliberative; it may occur immediately and implicitly. Even so, it is logically prior to action.

This sequence may be expressed, for example, in the relation *Fi → Fe*: first there is an internal evaluation of value, proximity, or repulsion (*Fi*), and only afterward does this evaluation manifest externally as conduct, expression, or relational adjustment (*Fe*). This process occurs in all cases, regardless of the individual’s degree of consciousness, since exteriorization always presupposes a prior internal orientation.

With this datum properly established, one may understand that dynamism in socionics does not consist in the attribution of pure phenomenological characteristics, even if such a reading is partially understandable. The notion of dynamic types refers instead to the manifest expressions of elements whose underlying structures may or may not be directly visible. It concerns attention directed toward the effective manifestations of processes, rather than toward their conceptual formulation alone.

In this sense, for example, *Te* is oriented toward observing how particular structural causes (*Ti*) lead to certain or multiple phenomena—that is, toward the way internal relations translate into verifiable effects. Staticity, by contrast, operates with these same contents decoupled from immediate empirical manifestation, in the manner of a mathematical postulate: not necessarily demonstrable at the factual level, but regular, logical, coherent, and internally consistent. Such structures are not visible in themselves; they become perceptible precisely through their dynamic expressions.

Thus, while static elements concentrate on the coherence of abstract systems, dynamic elements direct their attention to the details of how these structures manifest, privileging means that allow direct interaction with the phenomenon. One may, for instance, fully understand a system of differential and integral calculus and recognize its formal correctness (*Ti*); however, for this system to have practical relevance, it must be applied and manifested regularly (*Te*). Analogously, it is possible to produce an argument that is logically coherent and internally consistent yet does not correspond to any factual state of affairs.

### §§ Articulus III — De Vitali

Although this point is generally among the best explained within socionics, certain indispensable conceptual clarifications are still lacking. In the first place, the vital ring corresponds to automatic patterns of functioning, predominantly motor and reactive in nature, which ground practical perception of the world. Its function is to evaluate, in a qualitative manner, how beneficial or detrimental a given stimulus is—that is, the degree to which it contributes to or detracts from systemic homeostasis. This evaluation returns to the *Ego* block in the form of functional pressure: something is sought in a cumulative and contact-dependent way, as in the *Super-Id*, or manifested automatically, in a standardized and intense manner, as in the *Id*.

In this context, the recurrent claim that such processes are “conscious” proves to be mistaken, if not outright contradictory. Only the *Ego* organizes linear and deliberate interpretation of experience. To attribute direct consciousness to vital operations is to confuse distinct functional levels. A typical example of this confusion is the assertion that an *SLE* “works well because of *Te*,” when in reality *Te* in this case is contact-based, vital, unconscious, and strong. Its mode of operation is not autonomous: it depends on the structural course imposed by *Ti* and on the conceptual system previously adopted.
