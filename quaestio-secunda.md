# § Quaestio Secunda — De eo quod per Staticum, Dynamicum, Mentale et Vitale intelligitur

The proposal of these terms does not consist in the attribution of a set of phenomenological determinations—a point that will be further developed when treating Static and Dynamic—but in the description of interpretative patterns that characterize the way the intellect proactively relates to an object. It concerns, therefore, how the subject may describe a phenomenon, how it is intellectually apprehended, and how information is objectively internalized in this process.

What is at stake is not the phenomenon as such, but the manner in which it is interpreted after being observed. Faced with the same event, the intellect may orient itself toward a point prior to the event itself or toward the event as it occurs; this distinction grounds the terms Static and Dynamic. Analogously, a phenomenon may be described in a direct, immediate manner with relatively clear recognition of its causes—corresponding to Static Mentality—or it may be interpreted predominantly from its effects, characterizing Dynamic Mentality. In both cases, by logical coherence, there exists a passive context that accompanies and sustains this dominant mode of interpretation, which is designated as Vital.

Both dimensions are diametrically co-dependent, and all types observe distinct aspects of reality from equally distinct points. They are conceptually linearly dependent vectors: each component, when articulated with the others, must yield intelligible results within the same system, and it is precisely from this combination that observable effects such as types emerge. The aforementioned dichotomies do not describe isolated phenomenological contents, but serve to situate the individual within an interpretative standard deviation capable of producing structurally similar readings of distinct conceptual objects.

An illustrative example can be found in the comparison between Leibniz and Newton. One cannot claim that they were intellectually distant, insofar as both independently arrived at the formalization of differential and integral calculus. The central difference lies not in the final result, but in the mode of intellectual approach. Leibniz oriented himself primarily toward the analysis of causes and the formal relations underlying variation, treating calculus as a conceptual language capable of expressing continuity and rational structure. Newton, by contrast, focused on observable effects and concrete physical phenomena, seeking, for example, to determine the instantaneous velocity of a body at a specific point in motion.

Both reached mathematically compatible conclusions, but through distinct paths sustained by different passive regimes (Vital). While Newton sought to identify the exact value of a physical magnitude at a given instant, Leibniz was interested in the formal structure that made such determination possible. The object is largely the same; what differs is the interpretative orientation of the intellect and the point from which the phenomenon is apprehended.
