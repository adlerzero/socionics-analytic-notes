Returning to the previous example, Newton—here characterized as an ILI—and Leibniz—as an LII—present decisive convergences in the formal conclusions of calculus. Both arrive at mathematically equivalent results; the fundamental distinction lies in the point of departure of their reasoning. In Newton, thought begins from the observable effects of the physical phenomenon: the motion of a body provides the problem, and mathematical formalization arises as a response to that effect. Thus, the notion of instantaneous velocity is introduced as a quantity derived from the real event, expressed, for example, as \( v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt} \), where mathematical abstraction depends directly on empirical observation of motion.

Leibniz, by contrast, operates in a manner relatively decoupled from immediate empirical effects. Unlike Newton, whose conceptual construction remains dependent on the observed phenomenon, Leibniz formulates calculus from internal formal relations, in which *Ti* functions as primary in relation to *Te*. The focus rests on the structural coherence of the system, through relations between differentials such as $$\( \frac{dy}{dx} \)$$, independently of direct application to a specific physical event. In this way, the theory is constructed to possess its own systemic density, later applicable to the empirical world, but not grounded in it.

The passive regime corresponds to the *Vital*. Everything that is immediately recognized and rationally employed belongs to the mental ring, insofar as such elements are apprehended without prolonged reflexive mediation and function as organizing structures of experience. This distinction can be clearly observed in the following formulation:

> *The Static/Dynamic dichotomy derives directly from the mentality/vitality property, which defines the type of attentional engagement of the psyche with perceptual and conceptual data. The mind (mental functions) operates with more conscious and structuring aspects, while vital functions process background information that is more implicit or reactive.*

In light of this, it becomes evident that the *Vital* operates as a passive background sustaining the dominant interpretation, whereas the *Mental* actively organizes consciously recognized data. In Newton’s case, the progressive approximation to the instantaneous temporal point of an effect required the identification of regularities capable of ensuring predictability of motion. In order to determine an instantaneous magnitude such as $$\( v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt} \)$$, the conceptual structure had to guarantee the stability of the observed phenomenon—a movement in which the orientation proceeds from *Ti* toward *Te*.

Leibniz, on the other hand, concentrates primarily on the behavior of the system as a system, that is, on the formal coherence that allows such relations to be intelligible independently of any specific empirical event. In this case, the orientation is inverted: structural consistency (*Te*) grounds conceptual elaboration (*Ti*), as can be seen in the centrality
